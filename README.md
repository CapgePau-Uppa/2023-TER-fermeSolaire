This application is a website designed to optimise the placement of solar pannels 

To test the website : 

- Run npm install

- Run ng serve

- In the NodeJS file, run node index.js

You can easily add new filters by adding them in layers-list.service.ts and in the NodeJS index.js constant. This will automaticly create the front and back component such as the filter the GeoJson etc..
